# 🎙 Boggler

[한국어](README-KR.md)

It started in Dec 26, 2018

[The 6th D2 CAMPUS FEST Final Entry Project](https://github.com/D2CampusFest/6th) - in Naver D2

## ❓ What is Boggler?

Boggler's main point is that it analyzes the audio information that is streamed or entered into a file and converts it into text. For example, a conversation in a meeting or a speaker's voice is converted into text to provide a better typing environment.

## 💡 Motivation

Sometimes we listen to lectures or record important things. However, there is the inconvenience that such recorded material should be written in text. In addition, this task is easily forgotten unless it is absolutely necessary.

Boggler is being created as a tool to reduce the fatigue of work to convert speech to text.

## 💅 Style Demo

CodeSandbox does not support the core tools in this project, the deepSpeech and the waveform package, so you can only see style demos.
